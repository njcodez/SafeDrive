# SafeDrive Readme
SafeDrive is a comprehensive safety solution designed to enhance road safety and driver awareness. It encompasses a range of technologies and platforms to address various aspects of safe driving practices. Below is an overview of the technologies and components used in SafeDrive:

## Technologies and Components:
### Flutter: 
SafeDrive utilizes Flutter for building a user-friendly and cross-platform mobile application. Flutter enables seamless development for both Android and iOS platforms, providing a consistent user experience across devices.

### Kotlin: 
For native Android applications, SafeDrive is developed using Kotlin. Kotlin is a modern programming language that offers concise syntax, null safety, and interoperability with Java, making it an excellent choice for building robust and efficient Android apps.

### ESP32: 
SafeDrive integrates with ESP32 microcontrollers to create standalone hardware solutions for vehicles. The ESP32 is used to interface with various sensors and actuators, enabling functionalities such as drowsiness detection, collision avoidance, and real-time data monitoring.

### Camera Integration: 
SafeDrive incorporates camera modules with ESP32 to enable features such as driver monitoring, lane departure warning, and object detection. The camera captures real-time images or video feeds, which are processed using machine learning models for analysis and decision-making.

### Machine Learning Models: 
SafeDrive leverages machine learning models for various tasks, including drowsiness detection and attraction recommendations. These models are trained on large datasets and deployed within the application or integrated with ESP32 hardware to provide intelligent insights and assistance to drivers.

### User Interface (UI) Design: 
SafeDrive prioritizes intuitive and user-friendly UI design with Figma to ensure a seamless user experience. The app features clear navigation, informative dashboards, and interactive elements to engage users and promote safe driving habits.

### Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): 
SafeDrive adopts CI/CD practices to automate the build, test, and deployment processes. This ensures rapid iteration, bug fixes, and feature updates, allowing the app to evolve and improve over time.
